  <h1>Access to Healthy Food Is Not As Simple As Adding More Grocery Stores</h1>
  <h2>More study is finding a complex answer to solving the city's food deserts</h2>
  <div id="byline">By: Meg Callaghan & Thom Leavy</div>
  <div> <p>With limited time in the day and money in the pocket, bad habits are easy to form out of convenience and necessity. It’s why eating out of convenience stores is necessary for so many people, and fast food often trumps healthy living.</p>

<p>Picture an average minimum wage worker. She takes the C train from Brooklyn to work retail in Manhattan. She forgets her metrocard at work, and has to use the $5 in her pocket at the subway. It leaves her with just over $2 to eat when she gets back off at her stop, and she readily hands it to her local bodega owner for a single serving of Cup Noodles.</p>

<p>It’s a hot meal. It even has little vegetables in it. It’s better than nothing, and she doesn’t go to bed on an empty stomach.</p>

<p>The truth? It’s penny wise, pound foolish eating-- it doesn’t really feed you. Hearty Chicken Flavor Cup Noodles has 790 mg of sodium, 36 g of carbohydrates, and tends to leave you hungry. It’s not a solution to a single growling stomach, and it’s not a solution for the long term.</p>

<div><p>When Momofuku Ando invented instant ramen noodles in Japan in 1958, the public initially scoffed at the new product. But at the price decreased and the era of convenient food took off, so did those eating instant noodles. TV dinners and the like were not just marketed well, but offered a freedom from the costliness of home cooking, saving time and money with simplicity.</p>

<p>Today, Cup Noodle is a global brand, the Coca Cola of single serving instant dinner. There are other instant products, at least according to the global sales, that support microwavable meals being eaten in the millions. </p>

<p>What’s not convenient for consumers is that more and more, these products are linked to diseases like obesity. Research shows that these illnesses fall disproportionately on the poor. </p>

<p>The reasons why the poor rely on this kind of food are multifaceted, but until recently, talking heads pinpointed the reason in on location of stores and access, specifically the ‘food desert’-- expanses of the urban landscape where small corner stores were many, and full scale grocers were few. </p>

<p>The USDA defines a food desert as “parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas [...] largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers’ markets, and healthy food providers.”</p>

<p>They go on to describe local “quickie marts” as part of the problem with their “wealth of processed, sugar, and fat laden foods that are known contributors to our nation’s obesity epidemic.” These “low-access communities” must have at least 500 people (or 33 percent of the census tract’s population) living a mile or more away from a supermarket or large grocery store without a car-- expanding the range to ten miles for rural areas.</p>

 <p>While adding more or better stores was thought of as a cure-all, recent research has found that adding a new grocery store on the block. Neighborhoods still continue to buy and eat the same foods. Food inequality is too complex for one panacea. </p>

<div> <p>Corner stores and bodegas are cheap and convenient. The name, bodega, and the business model are of Latino origins-- they catered to the needs of Central and South America’s poor.</p>

<p>This is not to disparage all small business owners: the definition and fare of a bodega is not universal: there are some, like Concord Market in Brooklyn, that far exceed what one would typically expect from a bodega: no flies, a polished interior, and a variety of organic options. The difference? It’s located near Brooklyn Heights, where the mouths of the Manhattan Bridge and the Brooklyn Bridge meet. They make crab cakes, have a burrito bar, and blend fresh smoothies. They’ll take your order on the phone, or online, and deliver it to you.</p>

<p>And some of the less upscale bodegas make an effort to offer the fixings for a home cooked meal. They may boast a small delicatessen for a relatively fresh sandwich. The same can’t be said for their corporate counterparts, like 7-11, where the low fat options are the odd apple by the register, atop sugar free gum. The rest is individually wrapped, or slowly drying out under heat lamps and on rollers: cheese dogs, mini tacos, and frozen pizza glistening with grease.</p>

<p>The <a href=”http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas.aspx”>USDA Food Access Research Atlas</a> shows that in New York City, neighborhoods like Pelham, Woodside, Rego Park, East Elmhurst, Rockaway Park, Sunnyside, and Ridgewood have bad access to good food. Just across the Hudson, the density of poverty and scarcity of food appears more dire on the map’s visuals.</p></div>
